# Robotic-arm-simulation
I created this project under Tinkerers' Laboratory, IIT Bombay. Here, I have created the simulation using ROS (Robot Operating System) and Solidworks.
Solidworks is used to create different parts of the robotic arm and then those parts are coordinated using ROS.
### In the demonstration folder, you can see the video showing the simulation that I have created.
